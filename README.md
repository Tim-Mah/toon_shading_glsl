This project is an assignment for Computer Graphics. 

### What This Project Does
1) Display the normals as colours (z = blue, y = green, x = red)
2) Display Depth (From [0, 1]), where values closer were 0. Shaded greyscale from 0, 0, 0 --> 1, 1, 1
3) Shaded the object flat colour
4) output of the lapacian matrix shading, which uses the depth buffer and detects the edges of objects, outlining in white
5) Combine steps 3 and 4, and while specifying the number of colours shades we want, and outlines the edges in black.
